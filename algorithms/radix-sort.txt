Radix-Sort(A, k)
1.  for i = 1 to [log(b,k)] // [] = ceiling
2.      Counting-Sort(A, i) // use Counting-Sort to sort A on digit i (digit i = the key for sorting)

Counting-Sort(A, k)
1.  Allocate an array of lists C[1..k]
2.  for i = 1 to A.length
3.      key = A[i].key
4.      appand A[i] to the end of the list C[key]
5.  index = 1
6.  for i = 1 to k
7.      for j = 1 to C[i].length
8.          A[index] = C[i][j]
9.          index = index+1
